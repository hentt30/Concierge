## Introduction
We are a team of university students committed to variaty on musical taste. For this, using the software engineering discipline, we decided to create a platform on which we could achieve our goals.

## Objective
Our duty is to make people come out of their bubbles and discover new music.

## What is Concierge?
From this genre, the concierge platform manages to generate automatic playlists with just one click. After that, these playlists are saved, and the user can hear them whenever he wants.
